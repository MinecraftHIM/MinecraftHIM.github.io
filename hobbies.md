<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my 15-year swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## 我喜欢的影视作品

我很喜欢看剧还有动漫，偶尔会看看电影.

看剧比较多 比如Netflix非常烧脑的 《**黑镜**》系列,还有《**Inside Job**》都是讲的乌托邦世界和各种阴谋论的科幻离奇故事非常推荐.可惜《阴谋办公室》在第二季后就没有后续了，推特也停止了更新，且看且珍惜吧.

然后就是动漫了《**英雄联盟双城之战**》 还有我最喜欢的《**The Amazing Digital Circus**》看到下面的图了吗这就是神奇数字马戏团的各个人物 也有一些虚拟人物没有在里面，整个故事的每个角色都情感塑造的很好 也能看出很多深奥的问题让人深思.包括美术制作和音乐制作都非常用心 曲乐非常好听.这部动漫适合每个年龄段，并且每个年龄段的人的观感都会不一样.我太喜欢这个动漫了hhh.
